# React Three Fiber

## Experiencing Jank?

Whilst jank in `react-three-fiber` cannot be purely blamed on `react-spring` you
might find toward the end of an animation that there's a subtle jump,
which is visible in [this demo](https://y18m1.csb.app/). It's not pretty, is it?

Whilst by default it would be nice to have this issue resolved without you having
to interact and this is something we'll consider for the next `breaking change`
in the meantime what you can use is the [`precision` config prop](/common/configs#configs) to avoid this.

By setting the prop to a value like `0.0001` you can notice there is no jump towards 0.
This is because the precision prop is used to figure out how close the animated value
can get to the end goal before we consider the animated value to be equal to the end goal.
